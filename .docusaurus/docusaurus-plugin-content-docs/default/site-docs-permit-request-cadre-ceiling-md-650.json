  "description": "LGA user must manually allocate constraints to limit each Fully Automated and User Allocated Cadre (FAC and UAC) permits (see Figure 14). Here the user will specify the available number of each cadre throughout the whole country. By selecting the “Add Constraint” button (in blue in the upper right-hand corner), the user will be prompted to add a new constraint at any time. The “Reset Constraint” button (in red in the upper right-hand corner) deletes all created constraints at once. The “Actions” option in each row allows the user to edit and delete individual constraints.",
