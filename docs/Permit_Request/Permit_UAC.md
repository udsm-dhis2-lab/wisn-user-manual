The user will be able to enter UAC permits manually. The budget for Total UAC permits (based on salaries) will be deducted from the overall budget that has been allocated by the LGA user in the ‘Budget Constraint Step’. FAC permits allocation in initial optimization will then be re-run internally based on the remaining budget and will therefore impact the previous allocation.

Applying UAC permits requests for the new facilities

As mentioned previously, the UAC is prioritized for assignment and the remaining budget is allocated to the FAC’s. The number of FAC’s will change if any UAC’s are added as the budget is therefore decreased for FAC’s. Also, the user can download the UAC permit requests table and can even rest the permit requests.

Viewing UAC impact on Budget

If users enter permit requests that cause the annual budget to exceed, they will be rejected and the user will receive the notification pictured.
