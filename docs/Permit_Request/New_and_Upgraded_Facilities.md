---

In this section, the LGA user must confirm the new and upgraded facilities. New facilities are being developed by the GoT and certain facilities are being upgraded so the system will need to take this into account before any allocation is done. For a facility to be considered new, it must have been created within the past 15 months. This information will be provided in the system. The user will be required to add new and upgraded facilities at each LGA.

As new facilities will naturally lack HMIS data needed to produce the WISN output (needed staff) so the calculation is based on the average of existing HRH within the same LGA at the same facility type. For district hospitals, it is slightly different, given the overall number of district hospital facilities, so the calculation is based on the average of existing HRH across all district hospitals. Upon adding a new facility to the system, the WISN Report will be updated so that the information regarding average need is comprehensive. Finally, the user will be displayed with the PRI of the new facility based on the new average need and its existing HRH. The process below guides you through each step for this section.
