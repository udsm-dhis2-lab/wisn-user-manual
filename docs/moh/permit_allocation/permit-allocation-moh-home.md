# Permit Allocation

The permit allocation process will be used by the MOH user. The permit allocation process in the WISN+POA system refers to the annual permit allocation that is carried out by MOH and therefore they are the only users in the system with access to this specific section. The MOH user will be able to see the ‘permit allocation’ function on the left-hand side of the system to begin the process. The permit allocation process guides the user through a 6-step process with key functionalities that assist the user throughout each step.
