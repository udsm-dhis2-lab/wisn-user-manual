# HMIS Data

Users can upload and download HMIS data for facilities under their councils (Figure). The system is synchronized to the HMIS system (MoH system) and extracts the live data to be used by the WISN+POA for the necessary calculations. Users will need to click the “HMIS data” tab to view the list of HMIS data.  This data will appear as it does in Figure below.
