# Managing HRH Data

In addition to viewing cadre data that has already been uploaded to the system, users can also upload and download HRH data for facilities under their councils . Users will have access to HRH data that is to be extracted from the HRHIS system (MoH system) which will be integrated with the HCMIS system (POPSM system) to ensure accurate and live data is being fed into the system. Users will need to click on the “HRH data” tab to access this HRH data. Here, data will be presented as it is in Figure.
