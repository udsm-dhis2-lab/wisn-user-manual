All users must log into the system using their username and password. Access cannot be gained to the system without having a verified account and entering the correct login details, which are stored on the WISN + POA database. The system requires users to have internet access as the system is currently stored in the DHIS2 software. Once the user has entered the URL below, they will be directed to the login page pictured in Figure 0.

# Home Facility User

Upon login, every user will take his/her journey towards execution and completion of various tasks assigned to roles in the system. For each role, there are authorities associated with it, which grants or restricts permissions for each user towards managing tasks in the system. All users will initially be directed to the home page, where they can view a summary of the WISN data across the country for the 13 Fully Automated Cadres (FAC) which represent the core cadres. The user can view the data depending on the access level. For facility users will see data for the particular facility.

   Figure 1: WISN + POA landing page

The map on the landing page (represented in Figures 1 and 2) currently shows the net shortage  in each region as a default set, which is calculated by comparing the overall need with the existing number of staff. This net shortage can also be calculated by subtracting the surplus from the deficit.  However user can switch the map representation by also selecting surplus or existing data which are all colour coded. Clicking on the map, the user can view the data summary of specific geographical locations. Facilities are represented by dots and the map allows the user to zoom in and out to focus on the facility and its exact location.

On the landing page, when a user selects a specific facility, they will only be able to see the HMIS data and not the population data. The population data will read as 0 or N/A at the facility level.

Finally, the user is also able to download data shown on the home page. The user can download the graph in PNG format and the data from the table in XLS or CSV file.

Once the user has selected the download function, they will be provided with the option to download in either CSV or XLS format (see Figure 3). The user is also given the option at this stage to download the graph by selecting the option ‘include graphs.’ The files are then downloaded onto the computer as per the figure below. Downloaded pictures and excel documents will appear as in Figures 4 and 5, respectively.
