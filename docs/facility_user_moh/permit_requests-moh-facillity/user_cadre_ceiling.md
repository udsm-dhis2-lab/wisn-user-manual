# Cadre Ceiling

Facility user must manually allocate constraints to limit each Fully Automated and User Allocated Cadre (FAC and UAC) permits (see Figure 1). Here the user will specify the limit of requests for each cadre. By selecting the “Add Constraint” button (in blue in the upper right-hand corner), the user will be prompted to add a new constraint at any time. The “Reset Constraint” button (in red in the upper right-hand corner) deletes all created constraints at once. The “Actions” option in each row allows the user to edit and delete individual constraints.
