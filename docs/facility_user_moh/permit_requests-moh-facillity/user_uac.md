# USER ASSISTED CADRE (UAC)

## Permit

Figure 1 demonstrates how the system displays all UAC and any preset supply constraints. The user will be able to enter UAC permits manually. The budget for Total UAC permits (based on salaries) will be deducted from the overall budget that has been allocated by the Facility user in the ‘Budget Constraint Step’. FAC permits allocation in initial optimization will then be re-run internally based on the remaining budget and will therefore impact the previous allocation.

This functionality guides the user in their selection of manually assigning UAC permits requests.

   Figure 2: Applying UAC permits requests for the new facilities

As mentioned previously, the UAC is prioritized for assignment and the remaining budget is allocated to the FAC’s.  The number of FAC’s will change if any UAC’s are added as the budget is therefore decreased for FAC’s.  Also, the user can download the UAC permit requests table and can even rest the permit requests.

  Figure 3: Viewing UAC impact on Budget

If users enter permit requests that cause the annual budget to exceed, they will be rejected and the user will receive the notification pictured.

## Allocation

The system will display a new PRI list which takes into account the UAC permit requests. From the total budget, cost for UAC will be deducted and the remaining amount will be used to assign the permit request based on PRI.
