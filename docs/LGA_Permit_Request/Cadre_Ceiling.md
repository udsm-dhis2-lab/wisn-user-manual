LGA user must manually allocate constraints to limit each Fully Automated and User Allocated Cadre (FAC and UAC) permits (see Figure 14). Here the user will specify the available number of each cadre throughout the whole country. By selecting the “Add Constraint” button (in blue in the upper right-hand corner), the user will be prompted to add a new constraint at any time. The “Reset Constraint” button (in red in the upper right-hand corner) deletes all created constraints at once. The “Actions” option in each row allows the user to edit and delete individual constraints.

## Fully Automated:

Refers to the high-supply and high-volume cadres and users are provided with a recommended list for allocation based on the prioritization methodology

## User Assisted:

Refers to the low-volume and low-supply of cadres and the users are required to manually interact with the system before an answer is provided
