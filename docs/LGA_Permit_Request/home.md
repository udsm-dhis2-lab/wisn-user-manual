Upon login, every user will take his/her journey towards execution and completion of various tasks assigned to roles in the system. For each role, there are authorities associated with it, which grants or restricts permissions for each user towards managing tasks in the system. All users will initially be directed to the home page, where they can view a summary of the WISN data across the country for the 13 Fully Automated Cadres (FAC) which represent the core cadres. The user can view the data at different organizational unit levels from council and all the way down to facility level.

The map on the landing page (represented in Figures 1 and 2) currently shows the net shortage in each LGA as a default set, which is calculated by comparing the overall need with the existing number of staff. This net shortage can also be calculated by subtracting the surplus from the deficit. However user can switch the map representation by also selecting surplus or existing data which are all color coded. Clicking on the map, the user can view the data summary of specific geographical locations. Facilities are represented by dots and the map allows the user to zoom in and out to focus on the facility and its exact location.

On the landing page, users can also view a summary of the number of all health facilities in the country, population data, and the overall HMIS data for each selected organizational unit. However, when a user selects a specific facility, they will only be able to see the HMIS data and not the population data. The population data will read as 0 or N/A at the facility level because the system’s population data, which is obtained from PORALG, currently only includes data at the LGA level. For an example of this, see Figure 3.

The home page also allows users to compare data between different organization units at the same geographical level. For example, users can compare data across individual facilities without any limit on the number of selected facilities.

After selecting the geographical level (in Figure 4, “Facilities” has been selected), pressing the “Compare organization units” button will prompt the user with a list of organizational units at that level from which to choose. The user can select each unit from the list that they would like to compare. Selecting a unit will cause its color to change. After the user has selected all the units they wish to compare, they should click the “Compare” button at the bottom in the right-hand corner. See Figure 5 below for reference.

The summary of facility types, HMIS data, and population information will be summed for all selected organizational units for comparison. For example, the data in Figure 6 is a summation of data from the AJ Njia and Buguruni Health centers.

Once the user has selected the units they would like to compare, the map (Figure 7) and graph (Figure 8) on the landing page will automatically update to include the selected units. The table (Figure 9) will only show one organizational unit and the user will be able to select the other units they have selected from a drop-down list.

Finally, the user is also able to download data shown on the home page. The user can download the graph in PNG format and the data from the table in XLS or CSV file.

Once the user has selected the download function, they will be provided with the option to download in either CSV or XLS format (see Figure 10). The user is also given the option at this stage to download the graph by selecting the option ‘include graphs.’ The files are then downloaded onto the computer as per the figure below. Downloaded pictures and excel documents will appear as in Figures 11 and 12, respectively.
