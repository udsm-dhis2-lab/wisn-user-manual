So PRI list is helping on allocating a facility with more priority to give that permit of the particular cadre. So the total budget on this part is expected to be the one in approved cadre stage with total permits.


Once the apply constraint button is hit, cadres of selection will be highlighted in blue colors and the user can filter and view only the assigned list by pressing the PRI filter.
